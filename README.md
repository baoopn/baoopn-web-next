# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using TypeScript (`.tsx`) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The website serves as a portfolio where you can find information about me, including my short biography, projects, resume, and more.

## Features

- **Biography:** Learn more about who I am and what I do.
- **Projects:** Explore the projects I've worked on, including both professional and personal endeavors.
- **Resume:** View or download my latest resume.
- **Spotify Integration:** The website features a dedicated page that displays the music I'm currently playing on Spotify as well as my recently played tracks. This feature is powered by a custom API server.

## Spotify API Integration

The Spotify integration is handled by a simple API server that I created to manage requests to the Spotify API. If you're interested in how this works, feel free to check out the [Spotify API server repository](https://github.com/baoopn/spotify-api) on GitHub.

## Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** A React framework for server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level building blocks for designing custom UI without writing custom CSS.
